Rwall
=====

This is a very basic .Net/c# app that grabs wallpapers from Reddit for you, and is a work in progress.

To use, just complile and run the code. Pass in a subreddit as an argument to use a subreddit to get wallpapers from other than the default Wallpapers subreddit.

NOTE:
Requires .NET 4.0. Due to native windows API calls, this will only work on Windows Vista/7/8/8.1 with .NET 4.0 or higher installed.
